# TAM-Membrane-MD
Data and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation parameters investigating how lipidomic adaptation and membrane physical changes drive Tamoxifen (TAM) resistance in breast cancer. We performed multi-scale MD simulations on eight lipid bilayer models—ranging from normal asymmetric to cancer-mimetic symmetric states—to investigate their impact on tamoxifen (TAM) permeation.
